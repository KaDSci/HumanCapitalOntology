\r\r\r
"PROGRAM - The mission, functions, projects, activities, laws, rules, and regulations which an agency is authorized and funded by statute to administer and enforce. Exercise of delegated authority to carry out program functions and services constitutes the essential purpose for the establishment and continuing existence of an agency. The focus of a program may be on providing products and services to the public, State and local government, private industry, foreign countries, or Federal agencies. Most programs have an impact or effect which is external to the administering agency. In addition, comparable agencywide line or staff programs essential to the operation of an agency are considered programs in applying this guide; the impact of these programs may be limited to activities within one or a few Federal agencies.\r\r\r
\r\r\r
A program may be professional, scientific, technical, administrative, or fiscal in nature. Typically, programs involve broad objectives such as: national defense; law enforcement; public health, safety, and well-being; collection of revenue; regulation of trade; collection and dissemination of information; and the delivery of benefits or services. However, specialized or staff programs may be considerably narrower in scope (e.g., merit systems protection; nuclear safety; and agencywide personnel or budget programs). Programs are usually of such magnitude that they must be carried out through a combination of line and staff functions.\""""@en ;

It is listening with the intent to understand the other person fully, rather than listening to respond. Active listening includes asking wide-eyed questions such as, "How did you feel?" or "What did you think?".[3] This form of listening conveys a mutual understanding between speaker and listener. Speakers receive confirmation their point is coming across and listeners absorb more content and understanding by being consciously engaged. The overall goal of active listening is to eliminate any misunderstandings and establish clear communication of thoughts and ideas between the speaker and listener.[4]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening\r\r\r

"The following are examples of situations in which a cancellation is necessary:\r\r\r
\r\r\r
i. A decision orders an action to be rescinded, withdrawn or expunged\r\r\r
\r\r\r
ii. An appointing officer determines an action should never have occurred, for example: within-grade increase to GS-05, step 5 was processed when employee had completed only 52 weeks of service (instead of the required 104) at GS-05, step 4\r\r\r
\r\r\r
iii. Employee requests reconsideration of negative within-grade increase determination and the negative determination is overturned; for example, an action documented as 888/Denial of WGI must be rescinded\r\r\r
\r\r\r
iv. Appointment is void because of an absolute statutory bar to it, because the employee was guilty of fraud regarding the action, or >because the employee< deliberately misrepresented or falsified a material matter\r\r\r
\r\r\r
v. Change in tenure group, annual comparability pay adjustment, and realignment actions show employee to be at GS-05 when change to lower grade from GS-06 to GS-05 has been cancelled (cancelled actions must be replaced with ones showing employee to be at GS-06)\r\r\r
\r\r\r
vi. Resignation SF-50 of an employee who is serving an initial appointment probationary period shows, “Agency Finding: Resigned after receiving written notice of pending separation for misconduct.” (Since the appointment does not afford appeal rights, no “agency finding” or reasons may be placed on ***>the employee’s< resignation.

That is, a first-level supervisory position may be primary if it involves frequent direct contact, meaning personal, immediate, and regularly assigned contact, with detainees while performing detention duties that are repeated and continued over a typical work cycle. \r\r\r
\r\r\r
So, as I understand, the idea is that insofar that First-Level Supervisors are in direct and regular contact with their subordinates who perform detention duties, they themselves perform detention duties requiring frequent direct contact with detainees. And so, the performance of detention duties qualifies as one of their primary duties. And since a primary LEO position is one whose primary duties are either investigating, apprehending, or detaining [...], a First-Level Supervisor Position may be a primary position.\r\r\r

\r\r\r
One case in which Status Quo Appointments are used is when a permanent position held by an Employee of a public or a private enterprise is taken over by the Federal Government. In the context of the Federal Competitive Service, Permanent positions require what is called "Competitive Status" (whereas temporary positions do not). In this case, a Status Quo Appointment allows the Employee to retain their position without Competitive Status. In such cases, the Employee can then be later converted to a Career or Career Conditional Appointment with Competitive Status.\r\r\r

    rdfs:comment """This Separation Action requires discussion. Consider the following [from https://www.opm.gov/retirement-center/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c044.pdf]\r\r\r
\r\r\r
"An involuntary separation that may qualify an employee for a discontinued service retirement is any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee other than a separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency. These non-disciplinary actions are documented on the SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action, as "terminations.""\r\r\r
\r\r\r
As I parse this, any involuntary separation for reasons other than charges of misconduct or deliquency is marked with the Nature of Action Identifier 'Termination'.\r\r\r
\r\r\r
But if you look in the decision logic table from [https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa31.pdf], \r\r\r
\r\r\r
There are 3 cases--namely Rules 40, 46, 58--where the table directs the use of the NOA 'Termination' which seem to me to contradict the above.\r\r\r
\r\r\r
In Rule 40: separation is "Based on employee's conduct or delinquency after entrance on duty..."\r\r\r
\r\r\r
In Rule 46: separation is "Because of employee's conduct or delinquency after entrance on duty and because of unacceptable performance"\r\r\r
\r\r\r
In Rule 58: separation is "Required because employee failed, because of misconduct or delinquency, to qualify for conversion under Regulation 315.704"\r\r\r
\r\r\r
Are these not necessarily referring to 'charges of misconduct or delinquency'?\r\r\r
\r\r\r
There are also these rules directing the use of 'Termination':\r\r\r
\r\r\r
Rule 31 separation is "Based on unacceptable or unsatisfactory performance or other factors unrelated to misconduct or delinquency"\r\r\r
\r\r\r
Rule 60: separation is "Because employee failed to qualify for conversion under Regulation 315.704 for reasons other than conduct or delinquency, such as for failure to pass an examination"\r\r\r
\r\r\r
Which are all for reasons other than conduct or delinquency."""@en,
        "This appears to to be a highly disjunctive case. Several of the cases of Termination Action discussed in Table 31-B are those in which an Employee is separated from an Appointment that \"does not afford appeal rights.\" But there is no indication that this is a a feature that is shared in common by all Termination Actions."@en ;

    rdfs:comment """It is not clear that the scope of the OPM's use of  'Resignation-In Lieu Involuntary Action' is consistent with its definition for the term. The definition implies that in all cases the employee opts for resignation in lieu of an involuntary separation action. But the corresponding Nature of Action Identifier does not appear to be restricted to resignations in lieu of separation actions in decision logic Table 31-A. Thus, Rule 11, Table 31-A reads:\r\r\r
\r\r\r
"If Resignation is after employee receives written notice of proposed or pending position change, demotion, or termination for unacceptable or unsatisfactory work performance not covered under Rules 1-10, and Action is proposed under 5 CFR part 432, then NOAC is 312 and NOA is Resignation-ILIA."\r\r\r
\r\r\r
As position changes and demotions are NOT separations, this implies that the Nature of Action can be used for resignation in lieu of non-separation actions, in contradiction to the definition of that term.\r\r\r
\r\r\r
Demotions are even explicitly said not to be involuntary separations in chapter 44 of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices:\r\r\r
\r\r\r

"Appointment means any personnel action that brings onto the rolls of an executive agency as a civil service officer or employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2104 or 2105, respectively, a person who is not currently employed in that agency. It includes initial employment as well as transfer between agencies and subsequent employment after a break in service. Personnel actions that move an employee within an agency without a break in service are not covered. A break in service is a period of 4 or more calendar days during which an individual is no longer on the rolls of an executive agency."\r\r\r

A Temporary Appointment Period is a one-dimensional temporal region that spans one year or less. It is a defined class which has its own axiomatization."@en,

This use of the term 'time limited appointment' would exclude Temporary Appointments, which according to U.S. code, have a duration of 1 year or less. That said, OPM clearly uses the term 'time limited appointment' more broadly in other places.\r\r\r
\r\r\r
For example,\r\r\r
Chapter 10 of OPM's Guide to Processing Personnel Actions [https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa10.pdf] is explicitly said to cover all competitive services appointments that are time limited, where this includes temporary appointments of one year or less. \r\r\r
