\"PROGRAM - The mission, functions, projects, activities, laws, rules, and regulations which an agency is authorized and funded by statute to administer and enforce. Exercise of delegated authority to carry out program functions and services constitutes the essential purpose for the establishment and continuing existence of an agency. The focus of a program may be on providing products and services to the public, State and local government, private industry, foreign countries, or Federal agencies. Most programs have an impact or effect which is external to the administering agency. In addition, comparable agencywide line or staff programs essential to the operation of an agency are considered programs in applying this guide; the impact of these programs may be limited to activities within one or a few Federal agencies.

A program may be professional, scientific, technical, administrative, or fiscal in nature. Typically, programs involve broad objectives such as: national defense; law enforcement; public health, safety, and well-being; collection of revenue; regulation of trade; collection and dissemination of information; and the delivery of benefits or services. However, specialized or staff programs may be considerably narrower in scope (e.g., merit systems protection; nuclear safety; and agencywide personnel or budget programs). Programs are usually of such magnitude that they must be carried out through a combination of line and staff functions.\""""@en ;

It is listening with the intent to understand the other person fully, rather than listening to respond. Active listening includes asking wide-eyed questions such as, \"How did you feel?\" or \"What did you think?\".[3] This form of listening conveys a mutual understanding between speaker and listener. Speakers receive confirmation their point is coming across and listeners absorb more content and understanding by being consciously engaged. The overall goal of active listening is to eliminate any misunderstandings and establish clear communication of thoughts and ideas between the speaker and listener.[4]\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening

That is, a first-level supervisory position may be primary if it involves frequent direct contact, meaning personal, immediate, and regularly assigned contact, with detainees while performing detention duties that are repeated and continued over a typical work cycle. 

So, as I understand, the idea is that insofar that First-Level Supervisors are in direct and regular contact with their subordinates who perform detention duties, they themselves perform detention duties requiring frequent direct contact with detainees. And so, the performance of detention duties qualifies as one of their primary duties. And since a primary LEO position is one whose primary duties are either investigating, apprehending, or detaining [...], a First-Level Supervisor Position may be a primary position.

The definition implies that in all cases the employee opts for resignation in lieu of an involuntary separation action. But the corresponding Nature of Action Identifier does not appear to be restricted to resignations in lieu of separation actions in decision logic Table 31-A. Thus, Rule 11, Table 31-A reads:

\"If Resignation is after employee receives written notice of proposed or pending position change, demotion, or termination for unacceptable or unsatisfactory work performance not covered under Rules 1-10, and Action is proposed under 5 CFR part 432, then NOAC is 312 and NOA is Resignation-ILIA.\"

As position changes and demotions are NOT separations, this implies that the Nature of Action can be used for resignation in lieu of non-separation actions, in contradiction to the definition of that term.

Demotions are even explicitly said not to be involuntary separations in chapter 44 of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices:

\"D. Demotion in Lieu of Separation
A reduction in grade for unacceptable performance does not qualify the employee for discontinued service retirement because the downgrading is not an involuntary separation from service.\""""@en ;

For example, if an employee is appointed on 10-12-1998 and has 4 years, 3 months and 3 days of prior service that is creditable, the service computation date will be constructed as follows: When service credit of 4 years, 3 months, and 3 days, is subtracted from the date, 1998-10-12, the result is 1994-07-09.

One case in which Status Quo Appointments are used is when a permanent position held by an Employee of a public or a private enterprise is taken over by the Federal Government. In the context of the Federal Competitive Service, Permanent positions require what is called \"Competitive Status\" (whereas temporary positions do not). In this case, a Status Quo Appointment allows the Employee to retain their position without Competitive Status. In such cases, the Employee can then be later converted to a Career or Career Conditional Appointment with Competitive Status.

\"An involuntary separation that may qualify an employee for a discontinued service retirement is any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee other than a separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency. These non-disciplinary actions are documented on the SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action, as \"terminations.\"\"

As I parse this, any involuntary separation for reasons other than charges of misconduct or deliquency is marked with the Nature of Action Identifier 'Termination'.

But if you look in the decision logic table from [https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa31.pdf], 

There are 3 cases--namely Rules 40, 46, 58--where the table directs the use of the NOA 'Termination' which seem to me to contradict the above.

In Rule 40: separation is \"Based on employee's conduct or delinquency after entrance on duty...\"

In Rule 46: separation is \"Because of employee's conduct or delinquency after entrance on duty and because of unacceptable performance\"

In Rule 58: separation is \"Required because employee failed, because of misconduct or delinquency, to qualify for conversion under Regulation 315.704\"

Are these not necessarily referring to 'charges of misconduct or delinquency'?

There are also these rules directing the use of 'Termination':

Rule 31 separation is \"Based on unacceptable or unsatisfactory performance or other factors unrelated to misconduct or delinquency\"

Rule 60: separation is \"Because employee failed to qualify for conversion under Regulation 315.704 for reasons other than conduct or delinquency, such as for failure to pass an examination\"

Which are all for reasons other than conduct or delinquency."""@en ,

\"The following are examples of situations in which a cancellation is necessary:

i. A decision orders an action to be rescinded, withdrawn or expunged

ii. An appointing officer determines an action should never have occurred, for example: within-grade increase to GS-05, step 5 was processed when employee had completed only 52 weeks of service (instead of the required 104) at GS-05, step 4

iii. Employee requests reconsideration of negative within-grade increase determination and the negative determination is overturned; for example, an action documented as 888/Denial of WGI must be rescinded

iv. Appointment is void because of an absolute statutory bar to it, because the employee was guilty of fraud regarding the action, or >because the employee< deliberately misrepresented or falsified a material matter

v. Change in tenure group, annual comparability pay adjustment, and realignment actions show employee to be at GS-05 when change to lower grade from GS-06 to GS-05 has been cancelled (cancelled actions must be replaced with ones showing employee to be at GS-06)

By law, Veteran's Preference status may only be given to veteran's who are disabled or who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns documented in 5 U.S.C. §2108. The status entitles certain veterans to preferences over other eligibles in the Competitive Services hiring processing and also in retention decisions during reductions in force. Veterans with this status may also be considered for special noncompetitive appointments for which only they are eligible.

Examples of Pay Adjustments falling under this class are [all examples drawn from the Decision Tables from: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa17.pdf] 

-A decrease in or discontinuance of special rate schedule in the case of an employee (1) for whom the special rate is the highest pay entitlement
and (2) who is eligible for pay retention, where the employee’s existing special rate is between two rates in the new highest applicable rate range for the employee’s grade or level. Table 17-A, Rule 12

-a pay adjustment that occurs due to an employee losing GM status, their pay plan code being changed from GM to General Schedule. [GM status refers to the status of employees covered by the Performance Management and Recognition System termination provisions ofPublic Law 103-89.] Table 17-A, Rule 13

-a pay adjustment that occurs due an employee's current position being brought under the General Schedule. Table 17-A, Rule 14

-a pay adjustment that occurs as a result of a termination of pay retention because the employee declined a reasonable offer. Table 17-A, Rule 21

-An adjustment in an employee's basic rate of pay that is not described in Table 17-A, Rules 1-28 (e.g., GS pay increases under maximum payable rate rule; adjustments resulting from a change in employee’s pay system, etc.) Table 17-A, Rule 29

-A pay increase provided under 5 CFR 534.404(b)(4) which does not exceed the amount necessary to maintain the relative position of an executive’s pay rate within the Senior Executive Service rate range and is not considered a pay adjustment for purposes of the 12 month rule. Table 17-B, Rule 3

-any other Other pay increase that is not considered a pay adjustment for purposes of the 12-month rule (e.g., under 5 CFR 534.404(c)(3)(i)-(vii), 534.404(f), or 534.406(c)). Table 17-B, Rule 4

-a pay adjustment that occurs because an employee occupies a position that changed from the General Schedule to a Prevailing Rate System. Table 17-C, Rule 2

-a pay adjustment that occurs because an employee is subject to a reduction in a prevailing rate schedule resulting from the findings of a
wage survey and the employee's existing rate falls between two rates in the new schedule and employee's pay will be set at the higher rate. Table 17-C, Rule 7

-an employee has their rate of basic pay adjusted as a result of the termination of grade retention. Table 17-C, Rule 17

-a pay adjustment that occurs under the Prevailing Rate System because the employee is subject to an adjustment in basic rate of pay that is not
described in Table 17-C, Rules 1-17. Table 17-C, Rule 18

-a pay adjustment that is not covered by any Rule from Tables 17-A-C, and is not covered by Rules 1-7 of Table 17-D. Table 17-D, Rule 8."""@en ;
