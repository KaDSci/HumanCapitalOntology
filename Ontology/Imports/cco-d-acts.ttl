  dcterms:description "The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) Conformant Documents Ontology is a domain ontology that represents the generic domain of entities relevant to the creation, modification, or termination of social arrangements by means of some document. This includes social acts, deontic roles, and directive information and information bearing entities."@en;
  dcterms:license <https://opensource.org/license/BSD-3-Clause>;
  rdfs:comment "CCO-D-Acts is designed to fill a gap in representation of social, legal, normative, and deontic entities for ontologies that rely on the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) suite (https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies). Within the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) ecosystem, the Document Acts (D-Acts) ontology (https://github.com/d-acts/d-acts) is an extension of the OBO Foundry Information Artifact Ontology (IAO). This ontology proposes to transpose that OBO ontology into a CCO equivalent."@en,

  cco2:ont00001754 "Modified significantly. Originally by Amanda Hicks (D-Acts; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0020021) as 'identity document', which was a subclass of 'document', which is a Information Content Entity rather than an information bearing artifact. This is a critical difference. Moreover, the associated class having to do with 'documented identity' (another ICE) is obviated by CCO's Designative Information Content Entity. Original definition: \"A document that denotes some identity and is concretized by the bearer of some credential role.\" It was a defined class, equivalent to: IAO_0000310 and (IAO_0000136 some 'documented identity') and (RO_0000058 some (BFO_0000020 and (RO_0000052 some (RO_0000053 some 'credential role')))) and (RO_0000058 only (BFO_0000020 and (RO_0000052 some (RO_0000053 some 'credential role'))))"@en;
